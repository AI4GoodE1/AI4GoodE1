suggest a night at the theatre mr camerona sop to the party s europhobes has left the conservative leader defending the indefensible  he should beashameddavid aaronovitchon friday morning david cameron called upon david miliband to apologise  on friday evening i went to see a play  theplay was our class by the polish playwright tadeusz slobodzianek in a series of short  chapters  slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small polish village from number to number like the village the class was half catholic and half jewish  in number as the germans replaced the russians as theoccupiers almost all the jews of the area were murdered in a single day  slobodzianek shows what led up to themassacre and what happened afterwards  it is unbearable though the village is not named in the play it is based on real events that took place at jedwabne on july number number  aspoland s institute of national memory concluded in number on that day number number jewish men were forced to parade around thetown singing songs and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where one by one they were killed with knives axesand cleavers and then thrown in a pit  then number or more women and children were led from the town square to the barnand locked inside  kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight  the screams could be heard from twokilometres away  no one survived in number it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along  the murderers hadn t been germans butlocal poles as depicted in our class  alexander kwasniewski then the polish president apologised to the dead jewsand their survivors at a ceremony in jedwabne  in my own name and in the name of those poles whose conscience isshattered by that crime  history matters  few believe that as much as the law and justice party of michel kaminski who leads the tory backedgroup in the european parliament  the party s leaders have demanded apologies from the russians for the massacre ofnumber polish officers at katyn in number and their references to terrible polish historical suffering have constituted a bigpart of their political appeal but despite his historical sensitivity mr kaminski the mep for the jedwabne area did not support the number apology  heopposed it vigorously associating himself with the  committee to defend the  good name of jedwabne   among itsleading members were the local priest edward orlowski who   asked by journalists whether he would be attending theceremony at which the president apologised   said   these are all lies  it is not my business  germans are responsibleso why should we apologise  mr kaminski developed a slightly different rationale  as he told an interviewer for a far right webaddress our poland themurders   which he abhorred   were the work of a few outcasts and that he would only apologise if someone  from thejewish side  apologised for how  the jews  behaved during the soviet occupation from number to number  last month mrkaminski  who had denied giving the interview  confirmed this position   if you are asking the polish nation to apologisefor the crime made in jedwabne  he said  you would require the whole jewish nation to apologise for what some jewishcommunists did in eastern poland  it is this argument that so incenses me as it would anyone i think who had sat through our class  the idea of collectivejewish bolshevism was a major anti semitic trope before the war  it was a major element of self justification after it mr kaminski denied the apology denied the need for it equated the massacre to  jewish actions  and allied himself withthose who denied the massacre altogether fulfilling the historian pierre vidal naquet s observation about patterns ofmassacre denial   it never happened it happened but was justified they did it to themselves they did it to us   mrkaminski s view was described as disgraceful by mr miiiband  having read an enormous amount on jedwabne in the lastfew weeks i think mr miliband is completely right   it is disgraceful  and as he might well demand of mr cameron   ishould apologise  but more than that i find myself amazed by how mr cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreignsecretary descended from polish jews should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician whovehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of polish jews  i think of all the things that mr cameron hasgot right in his leadership of the  conservatve party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it now tory columnists bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collectiveguilt and to attacking non existent  smears  that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of mr kaminski why it is true as embattled conservatives have argued that many of the grand european coalitions contain people whosehistory is problematic  there are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping the epp and in the socialist group  butthese personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the ivierkels and sarkozys  the polish member of the epp forexample is the ruling free market non nationalist conservative party of donald tusk   almost certainly the party that mrcameron would join if he were a pole  the new tory grouping the european conservatives and reformists by contrastis all about odds and sods whom a continental cameron would certainly shun bar one organisation   the britishconservatives so why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the latvian ss wasn t so bad really and that mrkaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt  and the answer seems to be that mr cameron promised hiseurophobes in his leadership campaign back in number that he would leave the  federalist  epp and that the logicaloutcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending was it all necessary  no  was it in britain s interests  absolutely not  is it in the interests of progressive conservatism you must be joking  so has this happened because mr cameron doesn t really care enough about europe to thinkthrough the consequences of his own lightly given promises or because he s just as much a euro nutter as those sectsthe hannanites the cashists and the redwoodians this is the kind of advice i loathe but i ll say it anyway  go to see our class mr c  this is one hole you don t want tokeep digging  \n",
